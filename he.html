        Element Symbol and Atomic Number:

Symbol: He
Atomic Number: 2 (second element in the periodic table)
<br>
<h2>Physical Properties:</h2>

Colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at room temperature.
Boiling Point: −268.93°C (−452.07°F), the second lowest boiling point of all elements.
Density: Much less dense than air, making it ideal for filling balloons and airships.
<br>
<h2>Chemical Properties:</h2>

Noble gas: Helium is chemically inert, meaning it doesn’t readily form compounds due to its full outer electron shell.
Non-reactive: Helium does not react with other elements under normal conditions.
<br>
<h2>Occurrence:</h2>

Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, primarily found in stars (such as the Sun), where it is produced by nuclear fusion from hydrogen.
On Earth, it is relatively rare and is often extracted from natural gas deposits.
<br>
<h2>Applications:</h2>

Cooling: Used in cryogenics, particularly in cooling superconducting magnets (e.g., in MRI machines).
Balloons and Airships: Due to its low density and non-flammable nature, it is used in filling balloons and airships instead of hydrogen.
Scientific Use: Essential in various scientific fields, such as particle accelerators and research on quantum mechanics.
